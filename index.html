    <h2>What makes it fast?</h2>
    <p>
      Simply put, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles most websites have
      these days. Why? Because loading tons of javascript and elaborate CSS
      increases the amount of files(or connections) a browser has to retrieve
      and then once it recieves those files it has to process them all before it
      can display a site to a user.
    </p>
    <h2>So?</h2>
    <p>
      Users are impatient people, they don't want to wait 5-10 seconds for your
      site to fully load. And don't forget that with increased mobile usage most
      people are operating on a fairly slow connection. Which brings me to maybe
      the most important part of this project. Many developed contries have the
      luxory of high speed internet, but tons of people around the world don't
      have that luxury. The world's information exists on the internet now, and
      for people with limited or poor internet access a bulky website might be
      the difference between them getting critical information and not. This
      project is ovously far from saving any lives but if it can help people
      build nice looking lightweight websites that can be accessible on any
      device and browser even on the shittiest connection, I think that's pretty
      cool. So here we are.
