# Byte CSS

Byte CSS is a small(~ 900 bytes) CSS theme for building ultra lightweight webpages. Their are plenty of reasons why you may want to build a lightweight site, wheather it's for speedy load times, simplicty, accessibility or anything else. If you look around the Google machine you are probably going to find most people saying if you want a fast accessible site then you should forego the Javascript, CSS, Images, Videos, and Animations. They are correct, and you should listen to them, but for those of you who want to keep your site lightweight and still make it a little more user friendly I built Byte.

# Installation

Byte is very straight forward, when you want to use it, head into the `byte.min.css` file, copy the code from there. Open you html file, write out a `<style></style>` and paste the Byte CSS in between those tags. Repeat for all html pages that need it. Alternatively for a slightly slow load time you can just include the byte.min.css file like you would any other css file.

## Using Byte

### Preface

Byte is designed for ultralight websites. If you are not planning on building an ultralight site Byte is not going to help you very much. Byte utilizes 5 main components to a basic webpage, text, menus, buttons, forms, dividers. These 5 components should give you everytihg you need to get information onto the internet in a reasonaly nice looking way.

### Warning

If you are using any kind of formatter(like Prettier) in your code editor it will reformat the Byte CSS. This is not what you want. To get the best performace from Byte you should be using it inline in it's compressed format, like it is in the `byte-min.css`.
